# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made 3 tests pass for my C IJVM, two more to go! Started on my budget app, just laid out the basic html structure and some css.

**Thoughts:** Turns out that setting everything back to zero is very important if you want to avoid segmentation errors. Also, I really don't remember as much html and css as I thought I would.

### Day 2: May 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on making the very last test on my C IJVM pass and I have no idea why it doesn't pass :/ Oh well, that means practice with gdb. Also did a bit of jQuery on my budget app.

**Thoughts:** I'm so close with my IJVM, but so far still. I have a few ideas as to what happens but I don't understand why. Also did a bit of javascript/jQuery, definitely rusty with both of those, but I'll get some more practice in today.

### Day 3: May 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Memory leaks, memory leaks everywhere. I thought I'd be done with my CIJVM today, but nope, I still have to fix a few things. Also did shamefully little on my budget app. But I did listen to a podcast on containers.

**Thoughts:** Turns out my bug as most likely caused by the logger I used and many of my memory leaks too. At least I learned how to interpret valgrind messages though. For my javascript app, I decided that I need to re-learn quite a bit to make it work the way I want, so I'm back to The Web Developer Bootcamp.

### Day 4: May 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the C IJVM and did the DOM Manipulation section on Web Dev Bootcamp and the first section of Intro to Cyber security on Udacity.

**Thoughts:** So many things I want to learn and preferably all at once.. Oh well, I'm going to stick with my web dev stuff for now and do a bit of cyber security on the side.

### Day 5: May 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made comments on the tricky parts of my IJVM and finished up Advanced DOM manipulations and started the Color Coding Game. Also did half a section on Software Security on Udacity.

**Thoughts:** A bit slow today, learning by doing takes a lot of patience. Also need to come up with a new C project

### Day 6: May 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on my budget app and read a chapter on information security. Also did some SQL practice.

**Thoughts:** Got most of my coding done early in the morning, so it doesn't feel like I did so much in the evening. Also revised SQL on hackerrank, really like website, so I think I'll use it some more.

### Day 7: May 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got some more functionality added to my budget app, I can now add rows. Next up figuring out how I want to deal with the backend. Also did some Hackerrank stuff and finished the section Software Security on Udacity.

### Day 8: May 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do much coding today, but I did some research on NodeJS. Also set up github pages, so I can start building my website from there.

### Day 9: May 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Again a day of not so much coding, but I did plan out the coding that I need to do for my budget app. Also did the set up for NodeJS and MySQL. I also did research for a blog post on Makefiles I want to write.

**Thoughts:** NodeJS seems pretty cool, can't wait to start playing around with it and some of the packages it offers.

### Day 10: May 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not much coding again today, I can't seem to get it done before breakfast :/ But I did Express on Web Developer Bootcamp and got my files all set up, still need to play around with it though. Also wrote notes for Stack buffer overflows and more makefile research. I just tried to set my self up for a good days work tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** It's a bit slow progress at the moment, but I'll keep on keeping on and get through it.

### Day 11: May 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of debugging for express because my localhost + express.js did not want to cooperate. But I got a simple backend to work for my budget app which was awesome. Also watched some operating system security videos.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed working with express, surprising much.

### Day 12: May 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ran into some POST problems today with my express server that I have to solve :/ Also did some more makefile stuff which was really cool. I had some SQL to practice too for my Databases class so I completed the whole section on basic joins on Hackerrank. Most excitingly, I went to a meetup with Code Geek Carrots on Github which was really nice.

**Thoughts:** I'm not looking forward to debugging my POST problems. But I did really enjoy the meetup and I can't wait to go to another one!

### Day 13: May 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed my POSTing problems *high five* and did all the stuff I wanted to do for my front end of the budget app. Now I need to do the backend with the database and look into socket.io to update my front-end. It's going to be cool!
