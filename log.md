# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made 3 tests pass for my C IJVM, two more to go! Started on my budget app, just laid out the basic html structure and some css.

**Thoughts:** Turns out that setting everything back to zero is very important if you want to avoid segmentation errors. Also, I really don't remember as much html and css as I thought I would.

### Day 2: May 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on making the very last test on my C IJVM pass and I have no idea why it doesn't pass :/ Oh well, that means practice with gdb. Also did a bit of jQuery on my budget app.

**Thoughts:** I'm so close with my IJVM, but so far still. I have a few ideas as to what happens but I don't understand why. Also did a bit of javascript/jQuery, definitely rusty with both of those, but I'll get some more practice in today.

### Day 3: May 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Memory leaks, memory leaks everywhere. I thought I'd be done with my CIJVM today, but nope, I still have to fix a few things. Also did shamefully little on my budget app. But I did listen to a podcast on containers.

**Thoughts:** Turns out my bug as most likely caused by the logger I used and many of my memory leaks too. At least I learned how to interpret valgrind messages though. For my javascript app, I decided that I need to re-learn quite a bit to make it work the way I want, so I'm back to The Web Developer Bootcamp.

### Day 4: May 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the C IJVM and did the DOM Manipulation section on Web Dev Bootcamp and the first section of Intro to Cyber security on Udacity.

**Thoughts:** So many things I want to learn and preferably all at once.. Oh well, I'm going to stick with my web dev stuff for now and do a bit of cyber security on the side.

### Day 5: May 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made comments on the tricky parts of my IJVM and finished up Advanced DOM manipulations and started the Color Coding Game. Also did half a section on Software Security on Udacity.

**Thoughts:** A bit slow today, learning by doing takes a lot of patience. Also need to come up with a new C project
