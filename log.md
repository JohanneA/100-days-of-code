# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got started with Python, made small programs to practice loops, conditionals, objects, lists and dictionaries

**Thoughts:** Really enjoyed it and found python to be a lot easier to use than java. Very refreshing.

### Day 2: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did an hour of reading and doing exercised from The C programming languages in the morning and an hour of python programming in the afternoon. Had fun making a small Hangman game in python.

**Thoughts:** I found C surprisingly easy, as the syntax is very similar to java. Python just keeps impressing me with how nice and easy it is to do things.

### Day 3: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did more C exercises in the morning with simple output manipulation.

**Thoughts:** So far I'm liking working with C, but I'm definitely going to up the difficulty tomorrow.

### Day 4: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More C, started working with pointers and the difference between '\*' and '&'.

**Thoughts:** Pointers are interesting and something that I'm going to need to practice.

### Day 5: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still working on C and have now started to implement some of the standard C library. I also tried making my own header file and a test program that takes in command line arguments.

**Thoughts:** I had some trouble getting the .h file to work with my test file, but it ultimately turned out to be an error with pointers. Pointers are going to be more difficult than first anticipated.

### Day 6: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: By far the toughest day yet, I really struggled to get through the hour, but I managed. I continued my implementation of the C library, by working on strchr and setting up the header file with all the functions I want to make.

**Thoughts:** Pointers are still very magical, but the repetition helps.

### Day 7: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still struggling with pointers and making different functions from the C library. It's nice with a challenge though.

**Thoughts:** C is not as easy as I first thought...
