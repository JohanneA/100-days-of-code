### Day 1: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished 3 code wars katas and did some reading in Practical C Programming.

**Thoughts:** Who would have thought calculating the average of some numbers could be such a pain. I'm really enjoying C right now, which is nice considering I was hating a week ago.
