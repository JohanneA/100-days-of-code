# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made 3 tests pass for my C IJVM, two more to go! Started on my budget app, just laid out the basic html structure and some css.

**Thoughts:** Turns out that setting everything back to zero is very important if you want to avoid segmentation errors. Also, I really don't remember as much html and css as I thought I would.
