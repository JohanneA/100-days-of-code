# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made 3 tests pass for my C IJVM, two more to go! Started on my budget app, just laid out the basic html structure and some css.

**Thoughts:** Turns out that setting everything back to zero is very important if you want to avoid segmentation errors. Also, I really don't remember as much html and css as I thought I would.

### Day 2: May 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on making the very last test on my C IJVM pass and I have no idea why it doesn't pass :/ Oh well, that means practice with gdb. Also did a bit of jQuery on my budget app.

**Thoughts:** I'm so close with my IJVM, but so far still. I have a few ideas as to what happens but I don't understand why. Also did a bit of javascript/jQuery, definitely rusty with both of those, but I'll get some more practice in today.
